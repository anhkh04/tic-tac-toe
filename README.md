# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Introduction
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game for 2 players, where each player takes turns marking squares on the board with "X" or "O". The objective of the game is to form a row, column, or diagonal with three identical marks.

This game helps players improve strategic thinking and planning skills. Simple to play, but still challenging!

## How to Play
1. **Objective**: The goal of the game is to create a row, column, or diagonal with three identical marks (X or O).
2. **Controls**: 
   - Each player takes turns marking an empty square on the board.
   - The first player uses "X", and the second player uses "O".
   - You enter the number corresponding to the square where you want to mark (from 1 to 9). For example, if you want to mark square 5, you enter "5".
3. **Gameplay**: The game continues until one player forms a row, column, or diagonal with three identical marks, or the board is full, resulting in a tie.
   - **Game Board**:
     ```
         | 0 | 1 | 2 |
      ---+---+---+---+
       0 | . | . | . |
